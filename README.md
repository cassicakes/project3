##Approach

- First night I brainstormed ideas, thinking of things I enjoy doing, am interested in, and an app I would want myself that would be very simple due to my capabilites. I also reached out to friends and family about what their favorite apps are, why, and what they could change about it if possible. I also asked them what app they wish existed.

- I finalized my idea choice based upon finding an API with enough data.

- I wire framed every view, pop up, and documented what I would want to happen on each page. I also wire framed ORM functioning. Also browsed CSS ideas and color schemes

- Again like last project I started doing what I knew to do, which was build my very basic views, and routes for al main peieces. (pages, buttons, imputs, links, input feilds, nav bar, etc.)

- Once I had the basic layout I paired with someone to build the funcitonality in steps. I explained exactly what I wanted to do (which I noted thorughout the whole process), and together we went step by step to achive the funcitoing I desired. 
  - Making my database and models, migrating, associations
  - Grabbing informatin from page and storing database
  - Implemeting API, and coding correct queries, getting famililar with JSON layout
  - Authorizations
  - Catching all Erros
  - Deployed to Heroku

- When all was functioning I started adding stlying, making notes on what I wanted as I went. I utlized the inspect element for that.

- Sent a link to various friends to get feed back and to make sure it was repsonsive, and funcitoing on different platforms.


## Unsolved Problems

* As of right now, most of my styling is only on my index page, and I need to implement it across all views

* I want to add more parameters, better searching (key word search is a little wonky), and multiple APIS

* More benefits of having a profile, ie: making a social app of it, connecting with other people that atteneded the same event, add photos, etc. 

* Improve visability on mobile device view

* Adding more quirkness to showcase my style

* functionality for people that haven't logged in 

* Seperate search page?

## User Story

As a user I want an app that shows me things to do, I am bored all the time. 

I want to be able to search by location, date, and some sort of topic, or genre easily.

I want to be able to save multiple events, and I want to easily purchase tickets, on the same page or be linked to where I can.

I want to connect wih people that have attended, or will be attending events.
